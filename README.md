### Introduction
Mycelium is a turn based strategy game, in which you grow an imperium of subterranean funghi spores.
Despite its simple rules, the gameplay quickly results in unpredictable complexity and endless possibilities for tactical thinking.


### Rules
- Players alternately place dots ('spores') in their color
- Spores must maintain a minimum distance
- Spores that are close to each other connect
- Connections between own spores score 1 point each
- If one player has 7 points more than his opponent, he wins
- Spores with more than 4 connections die (own spores die first)


### How to play
- Place spores with space
- Navigate with the mouse
- Use the arrow keys to shift the board


### Speed
This is a modified version of the Mycelium game. Each player has a fixed amount of time to do his turns - indicated by a countdown in the bottom left corner. If one player exceeds his time limit, he loses.
